Welcome to BuildABackend! 

The url of the project -> buildabackend.herokuapp.com

This is a web platform to help YOU design backend architecture for your project.
We are currently only supporting the Flask/Jinja and MongoDb frameworks, but more will come at a later time!

Add HTML pages with their corresponding routes and request types, databases and dependencies! 

Once you are done, you can click the Download link to get a project folder with all of the specified files and as much pre-written code as we could manage. 

Happy Building!
