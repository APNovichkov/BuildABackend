This is a web platform to help YOU design backend architecture for your project. We are currently only supporting the Flask/Jinja and MongoDb frameworks, but more will come at a later time! Add HTML pages with their corresponding routes and request types, databases and dependencies! Once you are done, you can click the Download link to get a project folder with all of the specified files and as much pre-written code as we could manage.
